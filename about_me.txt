"No thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure to acquire." - L. Frank Baum.@@@ Mr. Baum's words ring true; knowledge is the most secure treasure of all.@@@
I <strong>love</strong> learning new topics, regardless of their foundation, whether in the arts or sciences, and regardless of the medium through which I encounter them—whether on television, in a novel, or even through a social media post. Once I come across a new topic, I make sure to learn all about it, as long as I understand what I'm reading about. For instance, when I saw ethical hacking, cybersecurity, and encryption techniques on 'Mr. Robot' (a TV series), I read about some of the basic techniques used in real life on GeeksforGeeks.com, such as the Caesar cipher and Bifid Cipher. I even created a basic Python program for using Bifid Cipher (without cheating by referencing the internet).@@@
Over the years, various topics, from psychology and myths to time travel, have fascinated me, but my passion for computers has remained unwavering—except when it freezes and I lose my work. I started learning Scratch, the visual programming language, in school (I believe it was in 9th grade), and I loved it for its ability to make sprites act according to the placement of blocks in a meaningful order. However, it was when I began learning Python that I discovered my true passion, and my understanding of programming began to flourish. I delved into basics such as operators and variables, both in class and by reading additional materials online. I sought guidance from my teacher whenever I couldn't make sense of the content on the internet.
