I <strong>love</strong> learning new topics, regardless of their foundation, whether in the arts or sciences, and regardless of the medium through which I encounter them—whether on television, in a novel, or even through a social media post. Once I come across a new topic, I make sure to learn all about it, as long as I understand what I'm reading about. For instance, when I saw ethical hacking, cybersecurity, and encryption techniques on<u><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_2_nm_6_q_mr.ro" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"> 'Mr. Robot'</a></u>, I read about some of the basic techniques used in real life such as the <u><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Caesar Cipher</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bifid-cipher-in-cryptography/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Bifid Cipher</a></u>.@@@
Over the years, various topics, from psychology and myths to time travel, have fascinated me, but my passion for computers has remained unwavering—except when it freezes and I lose my work. I started learning Scratch, the visual programming language, in school (I believe it was in 9th grade), and I loved it for its ability to make sprites act according to the placement of blocks in a meaningful order. However, it was when I began learning Python that I discovered my true passion, and my understanding of programming began to flourish. I delved into basics such as operators and variables, both in class and by reading additional materials online. I sought guidance from my teacher whenever I couldn't make sense of the content on the internet.
